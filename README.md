# OOP22-polycut

This game is an imitation of the famous game 'Fruit Ninja'. Once opened, the menu will be shown. You can choose between
3 buttons: play, rules, or exit.

- **Play:** Starts the game.
- **Difficulty:** Select the difficulty.
- **Rules:** Shows a pop-up window that explains in Italian what you will see in the game.
- **Exit:** Closes the application.

Once playing, you just need to move the cursor to start slashing the objects. If you do not move the mouse, you will
not slash the object, even if they pass over the cursor.

While moving, don't touch the bombs and don't let the polygons fall, or else you'll lose a life. Cut the polygons to
get points and try to beat the record.

While playing, you can press the ESC button to completely close the application.

**Good Luck!**
