# OOP22-polycut

This game is an imitation of the famous game 'Fruit Ninja'. Once opened, the menu will be shown. You can choose between
these options:

- **Play:** Starts the game.
- **Difficulty:** Select the difficulty.
- **Rules:** Shows a pop-up window that explains in Italian what you will see in the game.
- **Exit:** Closes the application.

Also, the game provides a series of **Power Ups**:

- **Bomb immunity:** Grants the player the immunity from the bombs for 10 seconds.
- **Freeze:** Freeze all the objects on the screen for 5 seconds.
- **Double points:** When cut gives 2 points instead of 1.
- **Increase speed:** Doubles objects creation speed.
- **Lose points:** When cut the player lose 5 points.
- **Double score:** Doubles the score obtained by an object for 10 seconds.

Once playing, you just need to move the cursor to start slashing the objects. If you do not move the mouse, you won't slash it, even if they pass over the cursor.

While moving, don't touch the bombs and don't let the polygons/power ups fall, or else you'll lose a life. Cut the polygons to
get points and try to beat the record.

While playing, you can press the ESC button to completely close the application.

**Good Luck!**
